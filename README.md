# filenameFix
Use the files.js and folders.js to fix based on type. Also make sure to change the string for the folder var that has the path that it's looking to clean.
This is meant to clean up most naming issues on files that are usually movies or tv shows for plex. 
I commented out the write command at the end so it can be run first and see what changes are being made then it can be uncommented when you are satisfied with the changes.

This was a tool a friend asked me to make for a Plex library. Sharing it with all now.
